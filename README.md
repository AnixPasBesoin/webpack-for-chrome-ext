## Acknowledgement

The code provided in this project aims to be as *minimalistic* as possible. If you happen to be looking for a more complete boilerplate code, you might want to check [chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate) (which has somehow inspired the creation of this repo).
